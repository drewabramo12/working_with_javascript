# working_with_javascript

## Overview

The goal of this challenge was to determine how best to add multiple filter searches on the categories of data that were reflected on our website. This involved updating both our app.js and our index.html files.

## Results

The multiple filtering works on a basis of two nested javascript functions. The first function saves the changes from any of the filter fields into an array. The second function which is nested into the first then takes those saved values and then applies them to the table. This allows for the UFO results to be filtered on any one search requirement to show similarities between them.
